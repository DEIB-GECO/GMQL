## Synopsis

[GMQL-Importer](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL/new/master/GMQL-Importer) gathers information from heterogeneous datasources and integrates them into the [Genomic Data Model (GDM)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202316303012) for further processing using [GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL)](http://www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it/genomic_computing/)

## Motivation

[GMQL-Importer](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL/new/master/GMQL-Importer) is meant to be the interface between the [GMQL-Repository](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL/tree/master/GMQL-Repository) and the different sources used in the [GMQL Project](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL), these different sources can have many data formats and procedures to obtain them

## Repository Structure

  * [GMQLImporter Base Components](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL/tree/master/GMQL-Importer/src/main/scala/it/polimi/genomics/importer/GMQLImporter)

  * TO BE COMPLETED...

## Installation

The full [GMQL Project](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL) can be pulled from the GitHub repository, installation of its dependencies is done by [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
The project still under development and no "user" installation is available right now, in order to set this up in your machine and help us in the development [GMQL Local deployment for developers Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ZnvL7vMJHZY5sNy3lcP-HidlCdxcLPfIwCD2nBAxvc/edit?usp=sharing) is being developed

[//]: # (## API Reference)

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Example

Once you have downloaded and installed [GMQL Project](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL) inside the [Source Folder](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL/tree/master/GMQL-Importer/src/main/scala), there is an example to run and check the basic functionallity of [GMQL-Importer](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL/new/master/GMQL-Importer)
